Machine Learning Introduction

- Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
- It focuses on building models that improve performance as they are exposed to more data.
- Machine Learning algorithms identify patterns and relationships within structured or unstructured data.
- The goal of Machine Learning is to make predictions, classifications, or decisions based on input data.

Types of Machine Learning

- Supervised Learning involves training a model using labeled data.
- Common supervised tasks include regression and classification.
- Unsupervised Learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns.
- Common unsupervised tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- Semi-supervised Learning uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data.
- Reinforcement Learning trains agents using rewards and penalties based on actions.

Supervised Learning Algorithms

- Linear Regression is used for predicting continuous values.
- Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems.
- Decision Trees split data based on feature values.
- Random Forest combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
- Support Vector Machines find optimal hyperplanes for classification.
- K-Nearest Neighbors classifies data based on closest data points.

Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

- K-Means Clustering groups similar data points together.
- Hierarchical Clustering builds nested clusters.
- Principal Component Analysis reduces dimensionality.
- DBSCAN identifies clusters based on density.

Reinforcement Learning Concepts

- Agent interacts with an environment.
- State represents the current situation.
- Action is a decision taken by the agent.
- Reward is feedback from the environment.
- Policy defines the strategy of the agent.
- Q-Learning is a common reinforcement learning algorithm.

Machine Learning Workflow

- Data Collection from databases, APIs, or sensors.
- Data Cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.
- Feature Engineering to create meaningful input variables.
- Data Splitting into training and testing sets.
- Model Selection based on problem type.
- Model Training using training data.
- Model Evaluation using metrics.

Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy measures correct predictions.
- Precision measures positive prediction correctness.
- Recall measures sensitivity to actual positives.
- F1 Score balances precision and recall.
- Mean Squared Error evaluates regression performance.
- ROC-AUC measures classification performance.

Overfitting and Underfitting

- Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise instead of patterns.
- Underfitting occurs when a model fails to capture data patterns.
- Regularization techniques help reduce overfitting.
- Cross-validation improves model generalization.
